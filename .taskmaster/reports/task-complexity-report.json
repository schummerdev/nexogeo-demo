			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement APM Monitoring System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the project structure, expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Backend Sentry SDK integration in the main API entry point. 2. Frontend Sentry SDK integration and error boundary setup in the root React component. 3. Implementing a centralized Winston logger module in `api/_lib` and creating a strategy to incrementally replace `console.log` across all API endpoints. 4. Integrating the `web-vitals` library on the frontend to report Core Web Vitals to Sentry. 5. Wrapping key API handlers in `api/index.js` with Sentry performance monitoring transactions. 6. Creating a new endpoint `api/monitoring/health` that provides basic system health metrics.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to integrate two new, significant libraries (Sentry, Winston) across the entire stack (frontend and backend). The task involves not only greenfield setup but also a considerable refactoring effort to replace all `console.log` statements in the API. It touches numerous files, from the root of the React app to every serverless function, and requires external configuration in the Sentry platform."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Redis Cache Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Integrating a Redis client (e.g., `ioredis`) into `api/_lib/cache.js`, including connection pooling suitable for the Vercel serverless environment. 2. Refactoring the cache-aside logic within `api/_lib/cache.js` to use Redis as the primary cache and the existing in-memory cache as a fallback. 3. Applying the enhanced caching logic to the data-fetching functions for `api/promocoes.js`, `api/participantes.js`, and `api/dashboard.js`, implementing appropriate TTLs. 4. Designing and implementing an event-driven cache invalidation mechanism, investigating either database triggers with a notification system or an event bus approach. 5. Creating a cache warming strategy for the `api/dashboard.js` endpoint and adding a new endpoint for cache health metrics.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. The existence of a central `api/_lib/cache.js` file is a significant advantage, providing a clear abstraction layer. However, the task's complexity is elevated by the need to correctly implement connection pooling for a serverless environment and, most significantly, to design and build an event-driven cache invalidation system using database triggers, which is a non-trivial piece of infrastructure that goes beyond simple application code."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Database Query Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Implementing `pg-pool` within `api/_lib/database.js` to manage connections for the Vercel serverless environment. 2. Performing a comprehensive analysis of queries in `api/_lib/database.js` and `api/dashboard.js` using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, and creating migration scripts for new composite indexes. 3. Designing and executing a migration plan to partition the audit logs table by date, including data backfill and application query updates. 4. Refactoring the participant filtering and audit log search functions to leverage the new indexes and partitions. 5. Implementing slow query logging by hooking into the database client configuration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This task goes far beyond simple query tuning. The requirement to partition a large table (audit logs) is a major, high-risk database operation that requires careful planning, migration scripting, and testing. Implementing connection pooling correctly in a serverless context is critical for performance and stability. The combination of deep database analysis, schema modification, and infrastructure changes justifies the high score."

			"taskTitle": "Advanced Security Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Implementing a JWT refresh token flow by modifying `api/auth.js` and related frontend logic to handle token expiration and renewal. 2. Adding rate-limiting middleware to the main API entry point. 3. Integrating CSRF protection middleware and ensuring it works with the frontend's data submission patterns. 4. Configuring security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) in the `vercel.json` file. 5. Creating a new API key authentication middleware and a system for managing keys. 6. Conducting a security audit of all API endpoints for input validation and sanitization vulnerabilities, and implementing required fixes.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. This task involves a fundamental and complex change to the core authentication system by introducing JWT refresh tokens, which affects both client and server logic. Furthermore, it requires a broad, time-consuming audit and potential refactoring of all API endpoints for input validation. The addition of multiple new security layers (rate limiting, CSRF, API keys) on top of the auth system refactor makes this a large and critical undertaking."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Progressive Web App Enhancement",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Creating and configuring `public/manifest.json` and enhancing `src/utils/serviceWorkerRegistration.js` to manage install prompts and service worker updates. 2. Extending `public/sw.js` to implement a network-first or stale-while-revalidate caching strategy for API calls to `api/promocoes` and `api/participantes`. 3. Implementing a push notification system, including a backend endpoint to send notifications and frontend logic in the service worker to receive and display them. 4. Implementing background sync in `public/sw.js` to queue form submissions made while offline and sync them when connectivity is restored. 5. Building the UI and logic for an offline mode, allowing users to view cached data when the network is unavailable.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. The project benefits from an existing service worker (`public/sw.js`) and registration file, which lowers the entry barrier. However, implementing robust offline synchronization, background sync, and push notifications are inherently complex features. They require careful state management, handling of edge cases (like sync conflicts), and development on both the frontend (service worker) and backend (push endpoint)."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile Experience Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Conducting a full audit of all components in `src/components/` for mobile responsiveness and creating a prioritized list of fixes. 2. Enhancing `src/components/Maps/InteractiveMap.jsx` by adding touch gesture support (pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan) using a library like `react-use-gesture`. 3. Refactoring form components under `src/components/CapturaForm/` to use mobile-friendly input types and layouts. 4. Implementing code splitting using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for major routes and heavy components like the InteractiveMap. 5. Redesigning the layout of dashboard components to be usable on small screens, possibly with a tabbed or stacked view.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This task is not conceptually complex but is broad in scope, requiring changes across a large number of frontend files. The complexity score reflects the significant time and effort required for the component audit and refactoring. Specific challenges like adding fluid touch gestures to a complex map component and strategically implementing code-splitting without degrading user experience add to the difficulty."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced LGPD Compliance Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Designing and implementing a data anonymization script that can be run on user data, and enhancing `api/audit.js` to log these events. 2. Building a consent management system, including UI components for consent banners/forms and backend logic to store and check user consent. 3. Creating a secure endpoint and process for users to request and export their data. 4. Implementing a 'right to be forgotten' feature with a secure data deletion process that cascades through related records. 5. Creating an automated data retention job (e.g., Vercel Cron) to anonymize or delete data based on configured policies. 6. Developing a new 'Privacy Dashboard' page for authenticated users to manage their consent and data.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. This task carries significant legal and technical weight. Features like data anonymization and secure deletion are high-risk and difficult to implement correctly and irreversibly. The task requires building several entirely new, full-stack systems (consent management, privacy dashboard, data export) and a reliable, automated process for data retention. The legal compliance aspect adds a layer of non-negotiable requirements that increases the difficulty."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Analytics and Insights",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Implementing a new backend service and database schema for tracking user behavior events. 2. Developing new complex aggregation queries in `api/dashboard.js` to support cohort analysis and retention metrics. 3. Enhancing `ModernChart.jsx` and `ParticipacoesPorHoraChart.jsx` to support advanced filtering, segmentation, and new visualization types. 4. Researching and implementing a simple predictive model for campaign performance, potentially using a JavaScript-based statistics library on the backend. 5. Creating a new 'Automated Insights' component that consumes data from dashboard endpoints and generates human-readable text summaries of key trends.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. While this task builds on existing dashboard infrastructure (`ModernChart.jsx`, `Chart.js`), its core requirements—predictive analytics, cohort analysis, and automated insights—move beyond simple data visualization into the realm of data science. This necessitates complex backend data aggregation, the introduction of statistical or ML modeling, and the development of logic to translate data into insights, all of which are significantly more complex than standard CRUD operations."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "External API and Integration System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Designing the public API resource structure and versioning strategy (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). 2. Implementing API key authentication middleware and a secure system for generating and storing API keys. 3. Building a robust webhook system, including endpoints for webhook subscription, an event dispatcher, and a queue with retry logic for reliable delivery. 4. Developing the initial set of public REST API endpoints based on the existing `api/index.js` structure. 5. Integrating a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI to automatically generate and host API documentation from code annotations. 6. Implementing API-specific monitoring for usage, performance, and errors.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This task involves building an entire product: a public API platform. The complexity is not just in creating endpoints, but in building the surrounding infrastructure required for a reliable, secure, and usable public API. A robust webhook system with queuing and retries is a complex backend project in itself. API versioning, key management, and documentation generation add further layers of significant work."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Real-time Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Architecting the real-time layer, likely by integrating a third-party service like Pusher or Ably, given the Vercel serverless environment. 2. Implementing the backend logic to push events (e.g., new participant, updated stats) to the real-time service. 3. Integrating the client-side library for the real-time service into the frontend to update dashboard components and map data live. 4. Building a full-stack feature for user notification preferences (UI and backend). 5. Integrating with an external service (e.g., SendGrid, Twilio) for email/SMS notifications. 6. Implementing a notification queue with retry logic on the backend to ensure reliable delivery for non-real-time notifications like email/SMS.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. The primary challenge is the architectural incompatibility of stateful WebSockets with a standard Vercel serverless setup, which necessitates using a third-party service and adds significant integration complexity. Beyond that, building a multi-channel notification system (real-time, push, email, SMS) with a robust backend queue, retry logic, and a full-stack user preference management system is a massive undertaking."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Automated Backup and Recovery System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: 1. Configuring automated daily backups and Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) for the PostgreSQL database using the cloud provider's tools (e.g., Vercel Postgres settings, AWS RDS). 2. Writing a formal Disaster Recovery (DR) plan document that outlines procedures for failover, data restoration, and communication. 3. Setting up monitoring and alerting (leveraging the APM from Task 1) to verify backup completion and report any failures. 4. Scripting and documenting a quarterly restore testing procedure to a staging environment to validate backup integrity and practice the DR plan.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This is an operations/infrastructure task, not a code-heavy one. Its complexity is moderate because modern managed database platforms (which are common with Vercel) automate the most difficult parts of taking backups. The work is focused on correct configuration, scripting, monitoring setup, and, crucially, creating and documenting robust procedures for disaster recovery and testing. While critical, it doesn't involve complex application logic."
